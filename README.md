# Introduction
This project was a brief 1-week sprint where our team tried to complete an MVP for an external user (Jane Doe).

# Description
This app helps link together proposals between business owners and freelancers. It displays it in two seperate sections with an explore freelancer section and a explore proposal section. It includes a login with individuals that introduce proposals as well act as freelancers. They are able to fill out proposals and submit them which will show up in exploring proposals. Once a user is signed up they are also created as a freelancer.

### Timeline
- Setup project infrastructure
- Send proposal to client
- Create wireframe and figma designs
